A light weight plugin which adds Next/Prev navigation to Woocoommerce products elegantly and responsively.

-  You will need Woocommerce plugin activated and have added products to see this plugin in action.

= Docs & Support =

- Due to the simplicity of the plugin there is no Docs, just activate and check out your WooCommerce single product posts.

- Please note that I might not be able to support this plugin, however, this plugin is light weight and should not have any issues. If any issues or conflicts arise you can simply deactivate it. If you still have an issue after deactivating and uninstalling the plugin then that means the issue is not because of this plugin as it clears itself 100% upon deactivation.

= WP Next/Prev Product Navigator will appreciate your kind support =

 - While most of the plugins I will add to to wordpress are originally functionalities I needed to use for my clients project, the time taken to transform them into a general plugin that works globally (on most themes) is time consuming and it is hard to continue with such contribution for this and other free plugins without contributions from users like you.
